What is YesterdayPy? - TLDR version
-----------------------------------
| A Python software to backup Linode configuration to local folder or Linode Object Storage.

What is YesterdayPy? - Longer version
-----------------------------------
| Have you asked the question "How was this configured yesterday?" while working with Linode, or any of the variations with the same meaning?
| If yes, YesterdayPy will help you find the answer.
| If no, well, you are in the wrong corner of the Internet.

| Note: There was already a project called yesterday in PyPI, so I just added Py in front of the name.
